Overall I had a positive experience but first workshop was very hard to start semester with. Ten minutes for the first quiz 
was a surprise too. In Autumn semester professor explained the lab part so it was very hard to do lab part in this one because
Cornel left it to us to figure out. Only after Midterm it became a bit easier because of coding experience. Having a quiz 
before the lecture on material was a big challenge too. Because of thet visiting lecture did not make sense and overall 
experience of the course is a self study. Quizes proved to be having things beyond reading materials so I lost a lot of 
marks before I found that out and started reading books for the quiz. I wish there were some videos as in first semester.
I studied 24/7 and still had difficulties with time. I feel exhausted and stressed out. I had nervous tic of my left eye after midterm.
I wish teaching was somehow more effective so I could have learned all this without so much stress. Midterm had little time to complete.
I wish there was autofiller for matrix because it takes time to debug with matrix testing. Reading week did not give rest 
because we had assignments for it that took all the time. Sometimes I had to use night time to complete assignments before 
the deadline and sleep schedule had been broken several times. Saturday and Sunday we used for quiz preparation and did not
give rest too. Overall wish is to make course more effective because I had to self study a lot.

In the final project I used C string instead of a stirng class in hope for a bonus. I also rewrote Time class calculations several times
to make them more effective in speed. Before I had temporal object declaration in some of them to change data of the const values for 
calculation. Then I discovered that creating additional objects and assignment operator is costly in C++ because assignment
operator does not allow "aggressive optimisations". I read about it on one C++ forum.
